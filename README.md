# LanguageRift

> Previously: Lol-language

A tool to quickly change the language of League of Legends

### Why?

Here's my case: I primarily play League in the Latinamerican North server, but I like to play the game in English. The problem is that the only language I can set Spanish. I tried to launch the client with the `--locale en_US` flag, but didnt work, tried to edit `Config/LeagueClientSettings.yaml`, nothing, and tried to edit `system.yaml`, nothing either.

The catch is that I was able to do it if I did the 3 things at the same time, so here's a program to make all of that automatically, for any region and language.
